# BouncingBallWithCollisionsAndScripts
 HoloLens app showing a ball bouncing off of a floor under the influence of gravity.
 
 The app uses:
          - the physics capabilites of the Unity and the ball is subject to a constant force.
          - the collision detection features of the Untiy game objects.
          - a script attatched to the bouncing ball to reverse the vertical velocity (y-axis) 
              whenever a collision is detected between the ball and the floor.
              
 Issues: The ball loses a small amount of energy on each bounce despite being "an elastic collision".
